    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>On a chili fall evening nothing warms my home like a pot of <strong>chili</strong>! My husband isn't a fan of the traditional tomato based chilies, so in our home we opt in for this healthy white chicken chili inspired by TexMix flavors.</p>
        <p>To be honest, I love to cook this recipe even in the warmer monthes. It's a one pot meal that's easy to heat and serve leftovers. Plus with the addition of guac and chips on the side it's a great way to enjoy family meal time.</p>
